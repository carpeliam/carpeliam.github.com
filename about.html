        Hello there, my name's Liam Morley. I enjoy cycling, rock climbing,
        hiking, and ultimate frisbee. I've been playing the piano for over
        two-thirds of my life, sometimes professionally, and I'm a
        singer/songwriter who has been in a
        <a href="http://www.thecolorsrun.com/">band</a> or
        <a href="http://www.myspace.com/coppertree">two</a>. I don't believe in
        scratch tickets, I have a poor sense of smell, and my culinary skills
        could use improvement. I once won second prize and $50 in a writing
        contest.

        Sometimes I like to write code. And when I write code, I like to write
        tests for my code, sometimes before I even write the code itself. And
        when I finish writing code, I like to post it on
        <a href="https://github.com/carpeliam">GitHub</a>
        so other people can use the code. A lot of what I write revolves around
        looking at ways to use the internet to connect people with information.
        From a language perspective, this usually involves Ruby, JavaScript, and
        HTML5.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently live about 45 minutes outside of Boston, Massachusetts, and
        I work at <a href="http://www.mitre.org/">MITRE</a> in the Open
        Services department.
