title: Is today the day Marty McFly arrives when he travels to the future?
description: It probably definitely is.
---

I recently implemented a [quick hack](http://carpeliam.github.io/istodaythedaymartymcflyarriveswhenhetravelstothefuture) (using image sprites/JS) to make every day [Future Day](https://www.facebook.com/events/462806337096634/), the day that Marty McFly arrives in the future. The JavaScript and CSS was pretty easy, although the Photoshop took me a little while. I threw it all up on [GitHub](https://github.com/carpeliam/istodaythedaymartymcflyarriveswhenhetravelstothefuture/), including the PSD file, so you're welcome to toy around with it.

As it turns out, I wasn't the first person to do this: [someone implemented virtually the same thing about a year ago](http://erikras.com/2012/06/29/back-to-the-future-day-hoax-generator/). Ah well, it was fun to put together, and I'm happy that I was able to build the PSD file without flattening the text layers, so that anybody else can fiddle with the filters/effects. Fork away!
