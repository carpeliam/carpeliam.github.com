if barack obama's speeches weren't pretty hot already, the guy from the black eyed peas set his post-New Hampshire primary speech to music, along with a whole bunch of other famous people. it's not connected in any way to obama's campaign, though i'm sure he's enjoying it now. i wonder if this will get radio play on clearchannel?<br /><br /><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ldF_bfoZPLo&rel=1" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ldF_bfoZPLo&rel=1" height="355" width="425" wmode="transparent"></embed></object><br /><br />i'm not sure if the youtube video will stay up, but [www.yeswecansong.com](http://www.yeswecansong.com) (currently redirecting to dipdive.com) has the full video.
