title: happy birthday to me

If you can read this, it means that [carpeliam.com](http://www.carpeliam.com) is successfully running on a virtual machine, running on top of [JeOS](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JeOSVMBuilder), nginx front-end proxy server, thin Ruby web app server, Rails, and what have you.

I also borked my windows installation while repartitioning my hard drive, so i'll be reinstalling XPx64 sometime next week. Yet another birthday present I'm giving myself. Woo.
