title: to make an omelette...
---

<img style="float:right;padding-left:15px" src="/images/shared/food-20120105.jpg">So 2012 is here, and I've run out of excuses to be terrible at cooking. So I purchased a book or two (the [how to cook everything](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/how-to-cook-everything-for/id409936319) iPad app, and I'm looking at [Cooking for Geeks](http://www.amazon.com/Cooking-Geeks-Science-Great-Hacks/dp/0596805888)) and went to town in the spices/baking aisles at Stop & Shop. Well, tonight, I made my first dinner, and it didn't turn out quite as well as I would have liked. This is probably not what omelettes are supposed to look like. Good news is, there's nowhere to go but up.

If you'd like to get together and cook with me sometime, let me know, as cooking is a lot more fun as a social thing, and I won't have to eat all of my mistakes by myself.
