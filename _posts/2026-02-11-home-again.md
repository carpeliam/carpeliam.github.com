It's been over 10 years since I last updated this, which seems about right for blogs in 2026. I moved back home to Massachusetts in 2016, have been living in Boston proper since 2021, and haven't felt a need to announce this on a homepage even once.

I've been busy just the same. In the same fashion as the move westward, my move back east had me visiting 10 national parks in 7 days, camping next to cows, and passing through Canada on my way from Detroit to Niagara Falls with all of my possessions in the back seat. In the years since, I've run a pandemic-year Boston Marathon, raising $15k for Boston Children's Hospital. I thru-hiked the Long Trail in 2023, the Appalachian Trail in 2024, and the John Muir Trail in 2025. I've been busy.

When I started this website, I was fresh out of college, looking to harness the power of the internet to build something cool. The internet still has undeniable potential, but the more time I spend on it, the more time I want to spend off of it. And that time has been rewarding. So who knows, maybe the following years will see me putting my thoughts into this format. But my best luck in putting thoughts out into the world has been in person, and I hope to see you out there.
