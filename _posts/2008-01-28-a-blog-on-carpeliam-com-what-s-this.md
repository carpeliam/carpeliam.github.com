title: a blog on carpeliam.com? what's this?
---

I've been blogging on and off since the [day I turned 22](http://imotic.livejournal.com/566.html) (way back in 2001). When I started doing server-side programming in PHP in 2002, [I made my own blog](http://imotic.livejournal.com/17288.html), but after a few months, the [GDC](http://gdc.wpi.edu/) (which was housing the website) [lost everything on their servers](http://imotic.livejournal.com/17477.html), and i didn't have any backups. After that, I wanted to try something that integrated into LiveJournal so I wouldn't have to worry about a database crash. I tried writing a Flash wrapper around LiveJournal, but that sucked hard. So when I started carpeliam.com, I had a spot for a blog to go, but it didn't actually exist.

Until now. I came up with the cool idea of housing the blogs on my own personal database on [carpeliam.com](http://www.carpeliam.com/), but simultaneously publishing it to LiveJournal through the [LiveJournal API](http://www.livejournal.com/developer/). I plan to add more features soon, like when I finish writing a song, it'll get a blog entry automagically. And of course there is an RSS for the whole thing, which might end up going up on facebook too. We'll just have to see what happens.
