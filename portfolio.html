          <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a> is such a nice place
          to put stuff, particularly code stuff. Here are a few of the things
          I put on GitHub these days:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b><a href="https://github.com/carpeliam/governor">Governor</a></b>
            <p>
              Because "Blogojevich" would be too tough to remember. Governor
              is a pluggable blogging system for Ruby on Rails v3. It's built
              for Rails application developers who want to easily tack on a
              blog to their existing Rails app while still maintaining a fine
              level of control. There's a built-in plugin architecture in
              Governor, which allows you to hook in to various plugin points
              at every level of the service. Check the
              <a href="https://github.com/carpeliam/governor/wiki/Plugins">list of plugins</a>
              to see what's currently available.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><a href="http://carpeliam.github.com/labelvis/">labelvis</a></b>
            <p>
              Labelvis is a jQuery label visualization plugin for rock stars.
              You have your choice of pronounciations, either "label viz" or
              "Lab Elvis". Up to you. Labelvis is similar to other plugins
              that add labels to your textboxes (like
              <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/labelify/">labelify</a>),
              but when you click inside the text field, a little box with the
              label slides up and sits nicely on top of the field. This is so
              you don't forget what field you're editing. This is helpful for
              really forgetful people, or in large forms that you'll need to
              edit later, and the default labels will have long since been
              replaced by whatever content your users have put into these
              fields.

          This was my senior project at <a href="http://www.wpi.edu">WPI</a>
          that I worked on during my junior year. Professor
          <a href="http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gpollice/">Gary Pollice</a>
          was interested in sponsoring an
          <abbr title="Major Qualifying Project">MQP</abbr>
          involving porting the Object Bench functionality over from
          <a href="http://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ</a> to
          <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>. BlueJ is an
          <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>
          aimed at teaching Java to students new to computer science. The user
          edits classes using a UML-like editor, and java code is created in the
          background. The user can also create instances of objects and place
          them in an "object bench", and manipulate them in a visual way.
        </p>
        <p>
          BlueJ is a decent IDE for beginners, but not so much if you actually
          want to write code. Gary wanted to port the useful functionality of
          the object bench over to Eclipse, which has an extensive plug-in
          architecture and is widely popular. My project partner and I ended
          up developing a very capable version of the object bench in Eclipse
          that was seamlessly integrated with the rest of the environment.

          In 2002, the <a href="http://gdc.wpi.edu/">WPI Game Development Club</a>
          wanted to build a <a href="http://www.myst.com/myst_home.html">Myst</a>-like
          game set on the WPI campus. I proposed using Flash as a development
          medium, due to its ease of interaction and rich scriptability, as well
          as most likely being pre-installed in most client machines. We first
          worked on a pilot prototype to float by the WPI administration. We had
          a script and some pictures, and I wrote the necessary code in Flash
          that made it into a playable game.
        </p>
        <p>
          After completing the demo and getting some feedback, I assumed the
          responsibility of Lead Programmer on the project when a few other
          people came on board. The final product would have a more involved
          storyline as well as a richer user experience. I sought out to write
          an API that would allow others to drop in scenes and add to the game
          without having to know Flash.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final product ended up being distributed to freshmen at the
          activities fair. It helped to publicize the GDC as well as help orient
          freshmen at WPI.

          I was contracted to design and build a website that would bring the
          restaurants of Worcester Massachusetts into the dorm rooms of college
          kids across the city. Up until the point that the website was publicly
          released, I was in charge of building a Ruby on Rails web application
          that be home to both college kids looking for a bite to eat as well as
          restaurant owners and site administrators looking to publicize and
          publish their menus. Features of the site included:

        <ul>
          <li>building a food search engine</li>
          <li>a blog to further interaction with users</li>
          <li>location-aware data (for finding nearby restaurants)</li>
          <li>time-aware data (for finding restaurants that are currently open)</li>
          <li>a restaurant rating and review system</li>
          <li>
            automatic mobile phone detection (mobile browsers are
            automatically served a version of the site that is mobile phone
            compatible)
          </li>
          <li>
            authentication and authorization schemes (making sure that regular

          Despite a role as lead developer with the Gompei Equation mentioned
          above, I don't consider myself much of a game programmer; I originally
          joined the WPI Game Development Club so that I might boost my C/C++
          skills. Instead, I ended up becoming the first webmaster for the GDC,
          and implemented a website using Apache's
          <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/">Cocoon</a> 2.0, built on top of
          Java, XML, and XSLT technologies. I assembled and led both a front-end
          design team and a back-end development team. As the members of my
          teams were undergraduate students with varying levels of skills in
          these areas, I also gave tutorial seminars to bring their skill levels
          up to the point where they could begin to contribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website was designed to face both members and visitors at the same
          time, serving the distinctly different needs of both of these groups
          simultaneously. I had grand ideas to unify the club through the
          website, where project leaders could administer their projects through
          the same interface that the secretary posted meeting minutes or the
          historian posted news articles.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the club was just getting off the ground, requirements gathering
          was a deep and on-going process. Various features included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A method for posting events, announcements, and news articles</li>
          <li>
            A home-grown forum system, intimately tied to the objects which
            were relevant to the club
          </li>
          <li>An extensible roles/permissisons scheme</li>
          <li>
            A method for creating/modifying/displaying development teams and
            their projects
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many features of an application framework that may now be considered
          standard were implemented within the application, such as a data layer
          for both wrapping relational models in Java objects and representing
          underlying JDBC calls.
