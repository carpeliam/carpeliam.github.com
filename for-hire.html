  <p>
    I'm a software engineer specializing in making teams and other humans more productive.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have decades of experience building on the web, mostly in the cloud. (Fun story, I was gifted 10 free shares of GeoCities stock for being a GeoCities "Community Leader".)
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a fan of XP practices like test-driven development and pair programming, and spent a decade teaching those techniques for a living. I like lean feedback loops and user-centered design.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm fluent in JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Ruby, Elixir, and others (somewhat dangerous in Python, Golang, and shell scripting). I have thoughts and opinions around AI that are a bit more nuanced than "what's your favorite agent".
